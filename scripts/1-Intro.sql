/*   1. Virtual Warehouses & Settings 

    Virtual Warehouses are the dynamic, scalable, and cost-effective computing power that lets you 
    perform analysis on your Snowflake data. Their purpose is to handle all your data processing needs 
    without you having to worry about the underlying technical details.

-- Let's first look at the warehouses that already exist on our account that you have access privileges for
SHOW WAREHOUSES;

-- You can easily create a warehouse with a simple SQL command

/*  2. Basic Transformation Techniques

    Now that our warehouse is configured and running, the plan is to get an understanding of the distribution 
    of our trucks' manufacturers, however, this information is embedded in another column 'truck_build' that stores
    information about the year, make and model in a VARIANT data type. 
*/
SELECT truck_build FROM raw_pos.truck_details;

/*  Zero Copy Cloning
 
    Snowflake's powerful Zero Copy Cloning lets us create identical, fully functional and separate copies of database 
    objects instantly, without using any additional storage space. 

    We can use this to make a development environment which will allows us to make changes to the data structures without changing
    production objects.

*/

/*
    After running the query above, we notice a problem in our dataset. Some trucks' makes are 'Ford' and some are 'Ford_',

    to become the new production truck table.

    The changes look great. We'll perform some cleanup on our dataset by first dropping the truck_build 
    column from the production database now that we have split that data into three separate columns.
